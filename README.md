Cyclone Pediction web app
Development of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Tropical Cyclone intensity estimation using half-hourly INSAT-3D IR Images and development of a web application for visualization of the imagery. 
Development of CNN based model for intensity estimation will be very useful during the initial stage of cyclone formation when determination of accurate center becomes difficult.

Need of solution
Government sites not so navigable
No centralized global Event Reporters
